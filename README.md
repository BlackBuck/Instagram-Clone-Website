# Instagram-Clone-Website
This is a nodejs project that is essentially an instagram-like clone

It includes features like profile search, account-section, login and register functionality.

Although there are some things that I didn't add or just didn't feel like it which include:-

1. The password checking in login page. You can literally login with the right username with any password. You can add that function as it's pretty easy to add-just a line or two.
2. The is no css for the login and register page.
3. The home page doesn't load the posts of the people you follow automatically(doesn't at all). But I will add that later.

With that said I want to tell the pre-requisites for the project.

1. Nodejs
2. MYSQL
3. Code Editor(VS Code)

Now for the node modules open terminal/command prompt and type in the following commands-

1. cd [DIRECTORY WHERE YOU SAVED THIS PROJECT]
2. npm install express multer mysql passport url bcrypt express-flash express-session path dotenv --save

You would also have to set up your database in mysql and then in the server.js file change the following![‚óè server js - Website - Visual Studio Code 8_19_2021 10_26_47 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67675436/130010680-48fc1be3-4a15-4a4f-b49c-385798100eac.png)


Done.
Happy Coding :)
